To Use this ISA you must take of these following points:

1. use labels with the colon immediately occuring after the label name without any space. eg: "label:"

2. use JZR to compare if value is Zero

3. use JEQ to compare if two registers are equal

4. use JLE to compare their inequality

5. you must insert START at the start of the assembly code
	and HLT at the end of the assembly code

6. use appropriate commands in assembly code. for eg use "MVI" to move immediate constant to a register and "MVR" to move a register to another register.
